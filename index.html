		   I am a member of the Camelid Family and a domesticated species of the South American camelid. 
		   My relatives Camelids,originated in North America over 40 million years ago. Camels migrated east via the Bering Strait and llamas migrated to South America. Today there are five recognized camelids breeds: camels, llamas, guanacos, alpacas, and vicunas. My big family varies by size and purpose, some of us being used primarily as pack animals and others valued for their fiber.
